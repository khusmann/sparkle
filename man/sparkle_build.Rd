\description{
Creates a self-contained static build of a Sparkle app that can be deployed
to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting service. The build includes
all R packages bundled locally for complete offline functionality and
long-term stability.
}
\details{
The function creates a complete static website in `output_dir` containing:
\itemize{
  \item index.html - Entry point with embedded app code
  \item bundle.js - React + Sparkle runtime
  \item repo/ - Local R package repository (if dependencies exist)
}

All R package dependencies are bundled locally, making the build completely
self-contained with no external CDN dependencies. This ensures demos remain
stable and functional indefinitely.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Build a single-file app
sparkle_build("examples/counter.R", "build/counter")

# Build a multi-file app

# Build and open in browser
sparkle_build("examples/counter.R", "build/counter", open_browser = TRUE)

# Serve the built app with Python
# cd build/counter && python3 -m http.server 8000
